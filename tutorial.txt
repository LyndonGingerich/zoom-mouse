You must now navigate blindly to find the food you can smell.

The game difficulty is decided by two settings:
1. The size of the space in which you must navigate.
2. The number of dimensions through which you must navigate.

For each dimension, you will enter a number to add to your current position.
So you will enter a positive number to move forward or a negative number to move back.

Your velocity readout is very important:
If it is positive, you last moved toward the goal;
if it is negative, you moved away from the goal,
if it is 0, you stayed the same distance from the goal.

To start, try looking in one direction at a time.
In dimension 0, figure out whether moving forward or back gives you a positive velocity.
(Just hold still in the other dimensions for now.)
Move 1 in that direction until your velocity goes negative, then go back 1 (by entering -1).

Do the same thing in each dimension. You will soon find your goal!
