You must now navigate blindly to find the food you can smell.

The game difficulty is decided by two settings:
1. The size of the space in which you must navigate.
2. The number of dimensions through which you must navigate.

For each dimension, you will enter "+" to go forward, "-" to go back, or nothing to hold still.

Your velocity readout is very important:
If it is positive, you last moved toward the goal;
if it is negative, you moved away from the goal,
if it is 0, you stayed the same distance from the goal.

To start, try looking in one direction at a time.
In dimension 0, figure out whether moving forward or back gives you a positive velocity.
(Just hold still in the other dimensions for now.)
Move in that direction until your velocity goes negative, then go back one.

Do the same thing in each dimension. You will soon find your goal!
